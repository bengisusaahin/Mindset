This project aims to develop an Android application using Jetpack Navigation and UI components. The application allows users to manage specific settings through a series of switches. Additionally, it creates a dynamic Bottom Navigation Bar that updates based on user interaction.


## Project Features

- When the application opens, the user is greeted with 6 switches. The "Ego" switch is enabled by default.
- When the "Ego" switch is enabled, the other 5 switches are disabled; when disabled, the other switches can be enabled.
- When the "Ego" switch is turned off, only a Bottom Navigation Bar with the main screen icon will be visible.
- Each time the user enables a switch, corresponding icons will be added to the Bottom Navigation Bar.
- Each item added to the Bottom Navigation Bar leads to a detail screen.
- DataBinding or ViewBinding is used across all screens.
